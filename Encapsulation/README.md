# How does this work?

**Cheese, Parmesan**
- This file demonstrates encapsulation, with the yum function.
    - It can only work in the cheeses function, not the in the parmesan class or outside the class

- The story of this file demonstrates if statements used to determine messages (and my love of cheese)
    - Using if statements the code presents different messages depending on values entered

- The child class of parmesan also used super() to inherit attributes from cheeses

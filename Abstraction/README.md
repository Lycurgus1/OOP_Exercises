# What is this?

- This a file showing the principle of Abstraction

- The method defined in exercise (drink_water) is required to be copied in the child classes
    - However it is modifed from the base and can be different

- The none abstract method is not required so not in the child classes

- The idea of this file is that you can exercise by swimming or running
    - Swimming is made more tiring and water consuming for concept testing (though this will vary in real life).
